Hello friends, this is Pauline.

**- Journaling since 2013**

Bucket list: to build a set of glass wall shelves to preserve all my journals.

Favorite motto at the moment: You look happier since you stopped being subtle about who you are and what you want.

**Confluence** 

*noun*  [ C ]   UK  /ˈkɒn.fluː.əns/   US  /ˈkɑːn.fluː.əns/

**the place where two rivers flow together and become one larger river** - Not your remote-friendly team workspace. 😌
